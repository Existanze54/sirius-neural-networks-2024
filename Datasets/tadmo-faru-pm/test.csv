The result at least in this final reel is truely interesting. Flash-backs subjective takes alternate editing all seems to be used without dispersion and beyond that practice of contemplative lingering on the framing that characterizes much of the Italian cinema up to 1920.

If in The Testament Cocteau portrays himself as a living anachronism a lonesome classical modernist loitering in space-time in the same buckskin jacket and tie while lost in the spectral light of his memories here he acknowledges explicitly the irony of his phantom-like state: by the time the viewer sees this image he J.

195207,From the Pole to the Equator,Documentary,it,The title Dal polo all'equatore was first used by the pioneering documentary maker Luca Comerio for a compilation film of 1925; it was used again by Yervant Gianikian and Angela Ricci Lucchi for their film of 1985. Much of the original has been re-worked: the 'found footage' has been re-shot slowed down tinted and re-edited with a sound track of minimalist composition. As a result the exotica of colonial travel and sport take on new and sinister meanings. The acts of violence especially those of hunting recur in patterns that suggest visually that war is a logical development. A close examination of the work starting with the opening sequence of a railway journey explores the centrality of questions of memory and history to this remarkable and influential film.,0.6,Gianikian-Ricci Lucchi-ZDF,1987-09-19,0.0,0.0,96.0,4.0

I longed to play with the color of film at its last gasp. I wanted to understand the relationship with the celluloid color timer (RIP) essential for the answer print. In so doing I learned the relationship was Talmudic at best like going to an Ophthalmologist (in failing sight) and hoping she listens to me as I tell her which lens works better. And chemicals and performances intervene. Innocence is lost. Yet the representation of light color nature shadows and a shaky camera persist.

I am interested in a creative geography of the city I've constructed. For instance the front of the hotel is from Berlin its interior was photographed in Copenhagen. The film offers the elliptical “scent” of espionage films (largely because of its Berlin locations) and offers that genre’s lubricating sense of voyeurism danger and sexuality.

309164,Line Describing a Cone,,en,LINE DESCRIBING A CONE is what I term a solid light film. It deals with the projected light beam itself rather than treating the light beam as a mere carrier of coded information which is decoded when it strikes the flat surface (the screen). It is projected in the normal way on a 16mm film projector. Though inevitably there will be a wall that limits the length of the beam a screen is not necessary. The viewer watches the film by standing with his or her back towards what would normally be the screen and looking along the beam towards the projector itself. The film begins as a coherent line of light like a laser beam and develops through the 30 minute duration into a complete hollow cone of light. Line Describing a Cone deals with one of the irreducible necessary conditions of film: projected light. It deals with this phenomenon directly independent of any other consideration. It is the first film to exist solely in real three-dimensional space.,0.6,,1973-01-01,0.0,0.0,30.0,2.0

The Boeing 707-138 VHEBA first flew in 1959 and had ended its days in England where it was to be scrapped. A team of retired Qantas engineers led by Peter Elliot decided that the aircraft would fly home again to Australia to be put on display at the Qantas Founders Museum at Longreach Queensland. This was the most complex restoration of a classic airliner ever undertaken involving 15000 man hours. Over six months period engineers and spare parts were shuttled back and forth between England and Australia. Working in all sorts of weather the engineers finally saw the aircraft fly again for the first time in six years. In Orlando Florida the team were greeted by Hollywood star John Travolta who owns another of Qantas's 707-138s.

We can see three women in traditional costume busying themselves around a sewing machine; the view is frontal the pose frozen a pure “Studio Marubi” snapshot. The insertion of a detail from Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe within this image looks like an “accidental encounter” introducing colours and nudity into a very classic photo. The characters in Déjeuner are gradually “swallowed up” by the sewing machine which soon will have finished weaving a traditional dress for the naked young woman painted by Manet making her similar to the seamstresses.

The basic plot was a cautionary tale about a young woman's journey into prostitution and white slavery but like the other films of the era the plot was secondary to the sexual content. Many of the presentations were introduced at the front door with live nude women in glass booths at the entrances. Inside the films were usually accompanied by a medical slideshow about venereal disease and a lecture from an alleged sexual education specialist. This was a typical presentation template for the time and set an example for later exploiters. (Wikipedia),0.6,Chadwick Pictures Corporation,1927-06-05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The same could be said of Kyrou's own directorial work in Greece before the advent of the 1967 dictatorship forced him to flee to Paris. This confused mess the first cinematic attempt at portraying the Greek resistance in WWII caused quite a stink upon release as much for its surprising style (recalling that of Bertolt Brecht) as for its subject matter. Reaction to its screening as part of the 1966 Cannes Film Festival's International Critic's Week was heated and divisive proving Kyrou's later statement by rising above its own inherent silliness to achieve a sort of rarefied critical status. It's bad drama that nonetheless succeeds by dint of audacity more than quality (a comment which could apply equally to the work of many exploitation directors like Jean Rollin whom Kyrou later so lovingly profiled).",0.6,Grift Film,1965-01-09,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0

130445,Consuming Spirits,Animation,en,Nearly 15 years in the making Chris Sullivan's Consuming Spirits is a meticulously constructed tour de force of experimental animation. Shooting frame by frame in 16mm Sullivan seamlessly blends together a range of techniques—cutout animation pencil drawing collage and stop-motion animation—into a distinct signature visual style. In the process he constructs a hypnotic layered narrative a suspenseful gothic tale that tracks the intertwined lives of three kindred spirits working at a local newspaper in a Midwestern rust belt town. The accumulation of these images builds to a great atmospheric effect achieved through an adroit combination of inventive set design ever-shifting visual perspectives fluid camera movements a vivid color palette and a haunting music track. Sullivan succeeds in creating with great artistry a hermetic self-contained world emanating from his own unique and vivid imagination.

I knew that this deeply rhythmic two-minute song needed some kind of somatic imagery. I needed to move with my body and my camera as I was shooting it.  A few days later I went to “The New Woman Behind the Camera” exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In this show I saw two photos by two women photographers from the 1920s whose work I had never seen before. These images guided me to a way of interpreting the physicality and the intimacy of Kristine’s song.  Soon afterward I invited my friend Kim Wilberforce to be in my film and to interpret the song herself through her vibrant wardrobe and her precise ecstatic clapping gestures.

In 2003 a civil disobedience campaign was successful in forcing the military out and the land has now been designated as a federal wildlife reserve. But this designation entails its own violence marginalizing the demands of island residents that it be fully decontaminated and turned over to municipal management. This conflict is the point of departure for Under Discussion. An overturned conference table has been retrofitted with an engine and rubber grafted from a small fishing boat. In liberal thought the table is a common architectural trope used for symmetrical communication and the non-violent resolution of conflict. Yet it often fails to account for the inequalities that structure spaces of negotiation.,0.6,,2005-01-01,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0

What effects did these actions cause?  Many Native people like Walter lived with this unresolved trauma into adulthood acting it out through alcoholism and domestic violence. At age 58 Walter decided to write and publish his memoirs as a way to explain his past abusive behaviors to his estranged children.

Cut it together later that day (be warned it's rough hence the 'sketch') and forgot about it! Until now. I'm trying to start sharing more while I work though because otherwise the gaps between the releasing of work would be much longer! And I'd prefer people see what I'm working on while I'm working so they'll be more excited when I release something 'proper' later on. Hopefully that includes you!

806451,Desiderata,,en,Paul Pfeiffer reformats film and television footage digitally editing or erasing figures objects and sounds. The adjustments demand a shifted and heightened attention from viewers often highlighting secondary overlooked details. Desiderata is staged on the set of The Price Is Right yet the set itself is altered the recognizable game parts multiplied to create expansive seemingly infinite spaces. The familiar tropes of the show are also missing: no Bob Barker no sound effects and no prizes. By removing the core characteristics of the game show Pfeiffer emphasizes deficiency. The work’s title Desiderata Latin for “desired things” also suggests absence: to desire something necessitates a lack of that thing. The video is presented on a portable screen designed for single spectatorship. Consequently the viewer inhabits a silent and solitary suspense that mimics the circumstances pictured on screen and is ultimately left to contemplate their own wants.,0.6,,,0.0,0.0,69.0,0.0

The men who don’t dance talk recite tell their own stories for and with the filmmakers. And be it through dancing or talking it is by sharing work space and time by making a film together as a community and by lovingly giving in to sharing that the film operates politically. It even makes a processional samba in the streets of Sao Paulo look like a show of inalienable collective power. Carried away by this power the film itself then seems to run away to overrun its own limits. Somewhere between fable and document improvisation and composition anger and joy all frontiers are burning. (Cyril Neyrat - FID 2021),0.6,Unexpected Films,2021-07-22,0.0,0.0,128.0,1.0

425462,The Big Stick/An Old Reel,,en,Saul Levine spent six years (from 1967-1973) cutting up and reediting 8mm prints of two Charlie Chaplin shorts IN THE PARK and EASY STREET into a dynamic yet dreamy deconstruction of physical and narrative movement. What begins with Chaplin looping around in circular repetitions between a Keystone Kop and an ominous vagrant becomes more fractured as the film expands. News footage of police arresting protesters (shot from a television screen on black-and-white 8mm film) is cut into the comedy of cops and criminals (a shot of political reality through the slapstick fantasy) and images are abstracted by rapid-fire cutting. Even the physical cuts of the celluloid become part of the image as Levine chops through the frames themselves leaving broad gashes on the screen and fracturing images until they overlap with the next shot and the suggestions of narrative are whirled into a frenzy of motion.,0.6,,1973-01-01,0.0,0.0,10.0,0.0

He's using a young drug addict (Hitomi Nakahara) to establish a connection with the bigger fish while taking extreme precautions to cover his own back. This film has more depth than most similar films from the era perhaps for being based on a novel. Particularly impressive is the level of detail in which the undercover job is depicted and the protagonist's attempt to lead casual family life while not on the streets. But the film is equally rich in nocturnal street atmosphere and gradually increasing tension enhanced by low key approach and minimal use of music. The early scenes with the undercover cops being driven around the city at the back of a truck are especially good.

450884,Doppler Effect Version II,Documentary,en,A sequel of his previous 1967 homonymous experiment Doppler Effect II moves one step forward in the mission of organising seemingly random stock footage along a rhythmical axis. By using found footage of diverse origin - political announcements animal life porn - and intertwining it with images recorded by Agnew himself-- cityscapes abstract light essays-- the film abandons any attempt of evoking meaning of any sort and focuses on a strictly formal exercise centred on time intervals and micro-relations between small sets of images. The soundtrack recorded by Duane Hitchings (known for his collaborations with Miles Davis and Hendrix but also for his Flashdance OST) on a Moog synth is an engaging exercise in abstract sonic dynamics and an essential part of the Doppler experiment in that it not only provides different aural settings for the diverse footage presented throughout the film but also aptly sets the pace for the fast succession of synched images.,1.091,,1969-01-01,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0

Meanwhile her obstinate daughter Suzanne draws the romantic obsessions of a well-to-do Chinese gentleman Monsieur Jo; though he could easily provide a way out the possibility of a romantic relationship between Jo and Suzanne could just as easily fall prey to local racial prejudices that would damage or ruin the lives of both.,1.84,Catherine Dussart Productions (CDP),2009-01-07,0.0,0.0,115.0,29.0

At each historic battleground he calls on a medium to summon the general’s spirit helping Alvarez-Mesa reveal Bolívar’s permanent and more or less visible presence in an array of social rituals and state structures. This historic legacy after two centuries transfigured into a blend of political mysticism and unchallenged military doctrine remains an integral part of Colombia’s collective unconscious.

Close combat through the streets of Fredericksburg and multiple assaults on the Confederate army entrenched in the heights behind the town resulted in heavy Federal casualties which forced an eventual withdrawal.

About a hundred men and women did their best to illustrate the actions of the thousands of young men who offered their lives a century earlier. An air of absurd theater suffused the entire event which provided the ground for its peculiar truth.

My intent is a re-seeing or re-visiting of the set by the camera which was one of the actual cameras used in shooting INTOLERANCE. All optical effects were done in the camera using high-contrast positive raw film stock. In keeping with the subject I made the film as a silent film with piano music from a cue sheet used in theaters during screenings of the original Babylonian sequence of INTOLERANCE so it is not an anachronism... only an acknowledgment to D.

Lacking an ongoing narrative frame the film combines fragments of stories from various places embedded in the images fictional or auto-biographical told through the voices scattered throughout the film’s soundtrack and elsewhere through the captions that bring a momentary sense of order through their consistently neat positioning.

338452,Flux,,en,In Flux Steina films a river from a wide angle deforming the image to the point of creating a sort of radiating aqueous ball - like a liquid planet turning in space. Steina alternately shows fairly rapid shots always taken at a very wide angle which film the river once in one direction and then once in the other; she thus obtains a simple visual and very efficient equivalent of the energy of the water. The close succession of the shots like the use of the reprocessed soundtrack of running water are all variations on the texture of the aquatic substance. Under the façade of a work far removed from realism Steina in fact offers a work that is in total contrast with the traditional images of running water but with her video vision comes very close to literary and pictorial visions of romanticism. She manages to translate the entire mythology of water into images without using narrative or symbolism but by simply using the possibilities provided by her camera and machines.,0.6,,1977-01-01,0.0,0.0,9.0,0.0

150653,The Third Bank of the River,Fantasy-Drama,pt,After an extended period directing original screenplays dos Santos returned to the creative engagement with literature that was the wellspring of his early masterpieces offering a combinatory adaptation of five stories by the renowned Brazilian novelist João Guimarães Rosa. Openly embracing a mode of magical realism dos Santos' celebrated film tells the story of a farming family defined by the absence of its father who abruptly abandoned his wife and children sailing away down the river including his son who continues to communicate with his father speaking daily to him from the river bank. While offering an evocative vision of rural Brazil as a timeless land of mystery and solemnity The Third Bank of the River is also bitingly satiric in the remarkable depiction of religious belief when the family moves to the city and its youngest member a mesmerizing little girl is revealed to be a kind of saint capable of miraculous acts.  -Harvard Film Archive,0.6,Regina Filmes,1993-08-20,0.0,0.0,99.0,3.0

329326,Diagram for Delinquents,Documentary,en,In 1950 America was in a state of panic. Juvenile delinquency was destroying the very fabric of society. Ninety percent of all children were reading comic books. In 1954 psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham wrote a scathing indictment of comics called Seduction of the Innocent. Its central premise: Comic books were the leading contributing factor to juvenile delinquency. That same year Dr. Wertham testified at special hearings on comic books at the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency in the United States. Comics were on trial. Diagram for Delinquents captures the zeitgeist of late 1940s and early 1950s America and investigates how the funny books found themselves on the fire. Using expert and comic book insider interviews never seen before historical photographs and films and animation DIAGRAM goes further than any previous comic book documentary to explore and understand the controversial figure at the center of this American tale: Fredric Wertham.,1.96,Sequart-Gambino Boys Studios-Scifideility Pictures,2014-06-15,0.0,0.0,133.0,0.0

Then one day inspiration struck as he picked up plastic trash on a beach leading him to launch a whole new career as a sculptor. Though acclaimed by curators he long went virtually unnoticed in the commercial-art realm. But at age 75 the unassuming Barrish may finally be on the verge of success as William Farley’s engaging documentary goes to show.

204295,The Return of Vasili Bortnikov,Drama,ru,Originally titled Vozvrachenia Vassilya Bortnikov Vassili's Return was the last directorial effort by the great V.I. Pudovkin who died in June of 1953. Like many of Pudovkin's later works the film was diluted by interference from communist party officials; what remains however is well worth having if miles removed from the brilliance of his earlier Mother End of St. Petersburg and Storm over Asia. Based on a novel by G. Nikolayeva the story centers upon a Russian named Vassili (Serge Lukynaov) who leaves his wife to do battle against the Germans in WW II. When Vassili is reported to have been killed in battle his wife Avodtya (Natalya Medvedeva) marries another man. Per the film's title Vassili returns only to find his wife ostensibly out of his reach. Vassili and his former spouse eventually reunite as friends if not lovers working side by side on a state-approved collective farm.,0.771,Mosfilm,1953-04-01,0.0,0.0,82.0,6.0

The universality of the theme of eternal struggle between the soul and the flesh is conveyed through the absence of specific reference to time or place: although the film seems to begin in 1840 its surreal mode effortlessly accommodates an automobile and the strains of “When the Saints Go Marching In” on an off-screen radio. Focusing on passion from a woman’s perspective and downplaying plot Sokurov explores his subject in exquisite detail capturing not only the heat of passion but also the quiet moments before and after and the innocent sensuousness of the body.,2.383,Lenfilm-Trete Tvorcheskoe Obedinenie-Interpromex Industrieanlagen GmbH,1989-01-01,0.0,0.0,168.0,12.0

895779,The Sheep in Northern Joseon Speak,Documentary,ja,In the 1930s Japan implemented a colonial policy called the “Policy of Sheep for North and Cotton for South.” The policy forced cotton cultivation in the southern region of the Korean Peninsula and sheep raising in the north in order to secure raw materials for its own industry. The film chronicles the process of transporting thousands of sheep on a boat from Australia to the Unggi region (now Seonbong in North Korea) how the sheep adapt after their arrival and the process of wool production. The narration of the film which appears as intertitles is from the sheep's point of view giving the film a whimsical children’s-movie-like touch. Although the film hides its purpose of explicit propaganda behind its family-friendly format it is of great importance; it gives us a glimpse into one aspect of the policy of expropriation of cotton and sheep under the Japanese colonial rule in the 1930s.

Jonas performs in a direct one-on-one confrontation with the viewer using the immediacy and intimacy of video as conceptual constructs. Exploring video as both a mirror and a masking device and using her body as an art object she undertakes an examination of self and identity subjectivity and objectivity. Creating a series of inversions she splits her image splits the video screen and splits her identification within the video space playing with the spatial ambiguity of non-reversed images (video) and reversed images (mirrors). Though Jonas' approach is formalist and reductive her performance reveals an ironic theatricality.

Scenes shot from morning to evening and then from evening to morning are divided into negative and positive frames resulting in four types of images that intersect manipulating the effects of film processing on perception.” (Tsuneo Nakai) Two versions of the film exist: 13:40 mins at 24 fps and 20 mins at 16 fps.,0.6,,1973-01-01,0.0,0.0,20.0,0.0

Unusually for an anime a narrator reads Kenji's story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can't put your finger on the reason why it's probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii's artsy 1986 feature Angel's Egg. That and Kenji's wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki's Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji's story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing and Kenji's magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.,0.6,Madhouse,1988-09-30,0.0,0.0,25.0,0.0

Monteverdi’s fabled opera Orfeo was long described as the first opera to have been written. Although modern scholarship has proven this to be untrue the work remains one of the pillars of western music history a musical creation which laid the foundations for much of what was to come. As musicologist Jack Westrup explains Orfeo marked a major milestone not because it broke new ground but because imagination had taken precedence over theory. While Monteverdi may not have been a revolutionary his music represents the culmination of centuries of musical evolution and shows him as the clear master of both polyphony and monody.,0.6,,1985-01-01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

826132,Silence,,xx,"""Two Jesuit priests travel to seventeenth century Japan under the Shogunate regime (which has isolated itself from all foreign contact) to see how the evangelical mission is going. There they witness the persecution of Japanese Christians at the hands of their own government which wishes to purge Japan of all western influence. Eventually the priests separate and Rodrigues travels the countryside wondering why God remains silent while His children suffer.“ I love this movie since i found this text! And i wanted to translate this story to an abstract short avantgarde film. I was inspired by the paintings of Sanchez Cotan who lived in this time the story is located. I want to show the develpoment of the emotions of the two priests. The drama is that everything can be excused in the catholoic church. Except the Apostasia - the doubt to the faith in God. You can steel murder or lie. You go to confession and everything is forgotten. But doubting is unforgivable.",0.6,,2012-01-01,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0
